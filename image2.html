      I specifically chose this image because I was drawn to the green color of the staircase and the way the sun was shining on it. When editing the photo, I wanted to give it the feel of an old image. I lowered the exposure and brightness slightly to highlight the sunlight coming through the window, but not too much that the staircase lost its details. Then, I added some grain to create more of a film-like feel. As well as, messing with the hue and saturation to add more of an orange filter that makes the image look like it was taken during golden hour. My vision for this edit was to make the image feel more cinematic, maybe like a still taken from a coming-of-age film.
