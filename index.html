      Creative Statement 
    </h2>
    <p>
      Through photography and videography, I capture moments, people, and places as they are. I find beauty in the ordinary, in things I see on a day-to-day basis. These are often the things I’ve unintentionally taken for granted. Recently, I’ve been paying more attention to my surroundings, no overthinking, just simply capturing what I see. My art isn’t usually planned, sometimes I travel or visit a location knowing I’ll take photos, but rarely with a specific subject or direction in mind. Much of my work is spontaneous because moments are random, and it’s those brief moments that I most want to capture and hold onto.

      Change is inevitable. Places and people are bound to change, and we cannot control that. At a young age, I realized I struggled with remembering people and places. I used to feel frustrated that I couldn’t recall certain memories of the country I was born in and spend the first 9 years of my life in. However, I also began to notice how quickly things changed around me in the present, and I didn’t want to forget what I was seeing. That’s when I started taking photos and recording short videos as a way to capture the essence of moments I was living before they slipped away. Through photography and videography, not only am I able to freeze random moments, but it also allowed me to be more present in my day-to-day, connect with my creative side without any barriers.
