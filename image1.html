      Before taking this photo, I was walking up and down the stairs in the North building, trying to figure out what to shoot. I was particularly drawn to this wall because of the three pops of red, such as the fire extinguisher itself, the “Fire Extinguisher” sign, and the number 5. While editing, I began to notice the wall’s imperfections and decided to emphasize the even more. I also wanted to make the staircase feel darker, older, and a bit unsettling. To achieve this, I lowered the clarity and exposure of the image, adjusted the gradient, and increased the dehaze significantly to bring out the patches and the overall texture of the wall, making its imperfections stand out more.
